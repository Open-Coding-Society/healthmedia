    "#### Primary User Story\n",
    "**As part of Legoland California's marketing team, I want to analyze the quality and performance impact of photos in social media posts, so that I can provide data-driven feedback on image selection and improve post engagement through optimized visual content.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extended User Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a visual content strategist, I want to use advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze photo characteristics including brightness, saturation, color composition, visual complexity, subject positioning, and aesthetic appeal, so that I can predict how well a photo will perform before publishing and optimize our visual content strategy for maximum engagement across different platforms and audience segments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a social media manager, I want to access an automated photo analysis system that can evaluate uploaded images in real-time and provide immediate feedback on their engagement potential, including specific recommendations for improvement, so that I can make quick decisions about photo selection, avoid posting low-performing visual content, and maintain consistent visual quality standards across all our social media channels.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a data scientist specializing in image analysis, I want to build sophisticated machine learning models that can correlate photo metadata, visual features, composition elements, and contextual factors with detailed engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments, saves, click-through rates), so that I can create predictive algorithms that help content creators choose the most effective images and understand the visual elements that drive audience engagement.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a content creation team lead, I want to receive specific, actionable recommendations for photo filter applications, image optimization techniques, composition improvements, and visual styling based on ML analysis and performance data, so that I can guide my team to consistently produce high-engagement visual content that aligns with our audience preferences and brand aesthetic guidelines.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a marketing analytics professional, I want to track the relationship between photo quality scores, visual characteristics, and actual post performance over time across different content categories and audience segments, so that I can validate our photo analysis models, continuously improve our visual content strategy, and provide evidence-based recommendations for visual content investments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a brand manager, I want to ensure that photo analysis tools can identify brand consistency elements and visual brand compliance while optimizing for engagement, so that our visual content maintains brand integrity while maximizing performance and audience connection.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a UX researcher, I want to understand how different visual elements in photos correlate with user behavior patterns and engagement types, so that I can provide insights on visual design principles that enhance user experience and drive meaningful interactions with our content.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a creative director, I want to use photo analysis insights to inform our overall creative strategy and visual guidelines, so that our creative team can produce content that balances artistic vision with data-driven performance optimization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Implementation Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a computer vision engineer, I want to implement advanced image processing algorithms using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch that can analyze photo composition, lighting quality, color harmony, visual balance, and aesthetic properties, so that marketing teams can receive comprehensive, objective assessments of image quality and performance potential before posting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a mobile app developer, I want to integrate photo analysis capabilities into content creation workflows using the Instaloader API for Instagram data extraction and custom mobile SDKs, so that content creators can receive instant feedback on photo selection directly within their publishing tools and optimize images before upload.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a machine learning engineer, I want to develop and train custom convolutional neural networks and vision transformers that can identify visual patterns associated with high-engagement photos specific to our industry and audience, so that our photo analysis system can provide increasingly accurate predictions about image performance and visual appeal.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a cloud infrastructure engineer, I want to build scalable image processing pipelines using cloud services that can handle high-volume photo analysis requests with appropriate load balancing and resource optimization, so that the system can process thousands of images efficiently while maintaining cost-effectiveness and performance standards.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a data pipeline engineer, I want to create automated workflows that can extract, process, and analyze image metadata along with visual features and correlation with engagement data, so that we can continuously improve our photo analysis models and provide up-to-date insights on visual content performance.**\n",
