    "## User story As a marketing analyst at Legoland devlopment, I want to analyze how different hashtags affect engagement used in social media posts, so that I can identify high-performing hashtags and optimize content strategy to increase patient engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plan: Hashtag Analysis API for Legoland's Social Media Engagement  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective  \n",
    "Develop an API that analyzes the impact of **hashtags** on **user engagement** in Legoland's social media posts. The API will collect data, process engagement metrics, and generate insights on which hashtags drive the most interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Data Collection  \n",
    "- Use **social media APIs** (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) to fetch:  \n",
    "  - **Post content** (captions, hashtags)  \n",
    "  - **Engagement metrics** (likes, comments, shares, impressions)  \n",
    "  - **Post timestamp**  \n",
    "- Store the collected data in a **PostgreSQL/MySQL database** for structured analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Hashtag Analysis  \n",
    "- Extract **unique hashtags** from each post.  \n",
    "- Group posts by hashtag usage and compare engagement metrics.  \n",
    "- Identify **high-performing hashtags** based on:  \n",
    "  - **Average engagement per post**  \n",
    "  - **Engagement rate per follower**  \n",
    "  - **Virality score** (shares vs. initial reach)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Engagement Trends Over Time  \n",
    "- Analyze how **certain hashtags perform at different times** of the day and week.  \n",
    "- Track engagement spikes or drops based on **time-of-day correlation** with hashtag usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ API Endpoints  \n",
    "Create API endpoints to access the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) `GET /hashtags/{hashtag}`\n",
    "- **Description:** Fetch posts containing a specific hashtag.\n",
    "- **Response:** Return posts with the hashtag, their engagement metrics, and timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) `GET /hashtag-performance`\n",
    "- **Description:** Fetch performance data of all hashtags.\n",
    "- **Response:** Return top-performing hashtags based on engagement metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) `GET /engagement-trends`\n",
    "- **Description:** Fetch trends based on hashtags and time of day.\n",
    "- **Response:** Return data about how hashtags perform at specific times or days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d) `POST /update-post`\n",
    "- **Description:** Update post information for reanalysis after a certain period.\n",
    "- **Response:** Confirm that the post data has been updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ Data Processing  \n",
    "- Use **Pandas** for processing the collected data and generating insights.  \n",
    "- Implement **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for analyzing sentiment and context around hashtag use (if relevant).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6️⃣ Reporting & Insights  \n",
    "- Provide insights on how different **hashtags** impact:  \n",
    "  - User engagement  \n",
    "  - Content reach  \n",
    "  - Follower growth over time  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate reports on which **hashtags should be used** for specific campaigns, based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies Used  \n",
    "- **Backend:** Flask or Django (for API setup)  \n",
    "- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL  \n",
    "- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy  \n",
    "- **NLP (Optional):** TextBlob or spaCy for sentiment analysis  \n",
    "- **Social Media API Integration:** Twitter API, Instagram Graph API, etc.  \n",
    "- **Deployment:** AWS, Heroku, or similar  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps  \n",
    "1. Set up social media API integration and data collection pipeline.  \n",
    "2. Implement the API endpoints listed above.  \n",
    "3. Perform initial hashtag analysis and compare engagement data.  \n",
    "4. Create a dashboard for visualizing top-performing hashtags and trends.  \n",
    "5. Test and iterate the API with real-world data to fine-tune the performance metrics."
