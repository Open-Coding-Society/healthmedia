We’re Michelle, Claire, Ava, Travis, Mihir, and Rutvik — a team of student coders and proud creators of this LEGOLAND® California hashtag analysis project. As huge fans of creativity and innovation (just like LEGOLAND!), we wanted to explore what makes Instagram posts really stand out in the world of theme parks.

Each of us focused on a different piece of the puzzle: post effectiveness, hashtag frequency, and the best time of day to post. Using real data and custom code, we built tools to help LEGOLAND better understand what gets the most love online — whether it’s a photo of MINILAND, a splash in the water park, or a dragon coaster zooming by.

Just like LEGOLAND uses bricks to build amazing worlds, we used code to build insights — and had a blast doing it!
