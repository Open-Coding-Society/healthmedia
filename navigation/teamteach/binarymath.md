## Introduction to Binary (Base-2)

Binary is a number system that only uses **two digits**: . 
- `0` (Off)  
- `1` (On)  

It is the fundamental language of computers, where every piece of data is stored and processed as combinations of 0s and 1s. Each binary digit (called a bit) represents a power of 2, depending on its position in the sequence. By combining multiple bits, computers can represent and manipulate everything from numbers and letters to complex images and sounds. Larger units like bytes (8 bits) are used to handle more information, enabling all modern technology to work behind the scenes!

## Binary Number System


```
| Decimal (Base-10) | Binary (Base-2) |
|------------------|----------------|
| 0 | `0` |
| 1 | `1` |
| 2 | `10` |
| 3 | `11` |
| 4 | `100` |
| 5 | `101` |
| 6 | `110` |
| 7 | `111` |
| 8 | `1000` |
| 9 | `1001` |
| 10 | `1010` |
```

#### Popcorn Hack 1:  Binary to Decimal Converter


```python
def binary_to_decimal(binary_str):
    decimal = 0
    for i in range(len(binary_str)):
        decimal += int(binary_str[-(i + 1)]) * (2 ** i)
    return decimal

#Get user input
binary_input = input("Enter a binary number: ")
decimal_output = binary_to_decimal(binary_input)
print(f"The decimal representation of {binary_input} is {decimal_output}.")
```

## Binary Addition

Adding binary numbers follows simple rules:

Each place in a binary number represents a power of **2**, starting from `2^0` on the right.

Start from the rightmost digit (smallest place).

Each digit is multiplied by 2^position (position starts at 0 on the right).

Add them up!

| A | B | Sum | Carry |
|---|---|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0    |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |  0    |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |  0    |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |  1    |

**Example:**  

```
   1011  (11 in decimal)
+  1101  (13 in decimal)
------------
  11000  (24 in decimal)
```

#### Popcorn Hack 2: Binary Addition Battle

How it works:

Step 1: The game randomly generates two binary numbers (between 0 and 255).
Step 2: The user has to add these binary numbers and input the result.
Step 3: The game checks if the result is correct and measures how fast the user solved it, providing feedback and points based on performance.

```python
import random
import time

def binary_addition_battle():
    # Generate two random binary numbers (up to 8 bits)
    num1 = bin(random.randint(0, 255))[2:]
    num2 = bin(random.randint(0, 255))[2:]
    
    # Show the binary numbers
    print(f"Add the following binary numbers:")
    print(f"Number 1: {num1}")
    print(f"Number 2: {num2}")
    
    # Start the timer
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Ask the user for the sum
    user_answer = input("Your answer (in binary): ")
    
    # End the timer
    end_time = time.time()
    
    # Calculate the correct binary sum
    correct_answer = bin(int(num1, 2) + int(num2, 2))[2:]
    
    # Check if the answer is correct
    if user_answer == correct_answer:
        print(f"Correct! You took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds.")
        print(f"Your score: +10 points!")
    else:
        print(f"Oops! The correct answer was {correct_answer}.")
        print(f"Your score: -5 points.")

# Run the game
binary_addition_battle()
```


How it Works:

Students will be given a random decimal number to convert into binary, and a random binary number to convert into decimal.
They have to answer as fast as possible, and if they are correct, they get a point.



## Binary Subtraction

Binary subtraction follows similar rules but includes **borrowing**:


**Example:**  


```
   1010  (10 in decimal)
-  0111  (7 in decimal)
------------
   0011  (3 in decimal)
```



```py
import random

def binary_subtraction(bin1, bin2):
    max_len = max(len(bin1), len(bin2))
    bin1 = bin1.zfill(max_len)
    bin2 = bin2.zfill(max_len)

    result = ''
    borrow = 0

    for i in range(max_len-1, -1, -1):
        bit1 = int(bin1[i])
        bit2 = int(bin2[i])

        sub = bit1 - bit2 - borrow

        if sub == 0 or sub == 1:
            result = str(sub) + result
            borrow = 0
        elif sub == -1:
            result = '1' + result
            borrow = 1
        elif sub == -2:
            result = '0' + result
            borrow = 1

    result = result.lstrip('0') or '0'
    return result

=print("üß† Binary Subtraction Challenge! üß†")
score = 0
total_questions = 3

for question_num in range(1, total_questions + 1):
    num1 = random.randint(8, 63)
    num2 = random.randint(0, num1)

    bin1 = bin(num1)[2:]
    bin2 = bin(num2)[2:]

    print(f"\nProblem {question_num}: {bin1} - {bin2}")
    user_answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()

    correct_answer = binary_subtraction(bin1, bin2)

    if user_answer == correct_answer:
        print("‚úÖ Correct!")
        score += 1
    else:
        print(f"‚ùå Incorrect. The correct answer was {correct_answer}.")

print(f"\nüéØ You got {score}/{total_questions} correct!")
print("Thanks for practicing!")
```
